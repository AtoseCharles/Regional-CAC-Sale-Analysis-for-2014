# Regional-CAC-Sale-Analysis-for-2014
Analysis on Regional CAC analysis. Working on this for a day, i was able to derive some insight such as Top Gross connection, Top dealers etc
We can Observe the following from the analysis:
1.	we had a total Sum of 474k Gross Activation.

2.	we have a total Sum of 450k Gross Connection.

3.	The total sum of TBLDT is 1T.

4.	we have 2294 sum of Gross Connection per LGA.
 
5.	we have 198,3292 sum of Gross Activation per Region.

6.	we have 4 Dealer Types per Region.

7.	Lagos is the state with the most Gross Activation with 74,008 while Ogun and Delta make the top 3 with 23,774 and 23,474 per state.

8.	SD-SRAA is the dealer with the highest Gross Connection with 237,104, while CR and SD-DATA make the top 3 with 109,393 and 44,241.

9.	SD-TRADER is the least dealer per Gross Connection with 23,667.

10.	Alimosho is the LGA with the top Gross Connection with 1612, while Eti Osa and Municipal Area Council with 1603 and 1390 make the top 3. 

11.	North has the highest number of Gross Connections per Device Type with 136,587, while Lsw and East have 108,501 and 66,450 respectively.

RECOMMENDATION:
I recommend the following from the analysis:
1.	we should give SD-SRAA more products at lower rate to encourage him and motivate the other dealer we have.

2.	we should ask SD-SRA to tutor SD-TRADER for a while and all our dealers should follow SD-SRAA mode.


3.	we should open more branches in the North due to it high demand over there.

4.	we need to do more promotion in the East to boost the usage.
